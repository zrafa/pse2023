Acknowledgments

Michael M. Minor: he is the author of another AVR port os Xinu 
(https://sites.google.com/site/avrxinu/)
We use his context switch code, the addargs in Xinu shell, and 
a few lines more. His port is for bigger AVR microcontrollers 
(16KB+ of RAM), and he used an old version of Xinu (Xinu from 
the 1987 book edition).
